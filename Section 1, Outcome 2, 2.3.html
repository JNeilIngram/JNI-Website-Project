            <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
            </h2>
            <p>I am content with the overall design and look of the website overall. It is functional with all navigation working and the 
                overall look was, for the most part, what I wanted.
            </p>
            <p>Things I would change are as follows:-
            </p>
            <p>Firstly the navigation bar needs work. Ideally I wanted the "home" button on the left and all other buttons and drop downs on 
                the right.</p> 
            <p>Secondly the Main Title is clickable (it returns to the "home" page), but is not showing correctly. It should be red (going 
                dark red on hover) without an underline.</p>
                <p>I also acknowledge that some of the content is weak, but time pressures force this.</p>
            <p>The joke adverts included on the site were intended to be randomly appearing either on page load or after every say 30 seconds.
                 As Java script was only covered after the completion of this project, this was beyond my capabilities.</p>   
            <p>Finally, I was unable to implement an Anti-Mac protocol. The software and coding required to achieve this were beyond the 
                scope of this course.</p>
