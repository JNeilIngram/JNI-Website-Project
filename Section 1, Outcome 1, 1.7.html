            <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects â€“ How does GDPR impact digital projects?
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>The legal framework under which all IT projects is complex and disparate. Each project potentially has its own applicable law as well 
                as the more generic law applicable to all projects such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>Project specific legal requirements need to be discussed with those responsible for commissioning the project and ideally should be 
                included within the project brief.
            </p>
            <p>The generic legal requirements applicable to all projects mainly centre around the retention and processing of personal data, which 
                is defined as "any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by 
                reference to an identifier". [2]
            </p>
            <p>There are specific responsibilities regarding the holding, processing and deletion of personal data that those responsible for a 
                project need to be aware of:-
            </p>
            <ol>
        
                <li>They only hold what data they need, for the specific purpose that they hold the data.
                </li>
                <li>Any additional personal data that they request is given and held with the informed consent of individual concerned.</li>
                <li>The processing of any personal data over and above either statutory requirements and/or the purpose it was originally collected 
                    has the informed consent of the individual concerned.</li>
                <li>Any data held needs to be deleted in a timely fashion if:-</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>The purpose for which the data is held has concluded.</li>
                    <li>There is no statutory or other requirement to retain some or all of the data for a specific time period.  The retained 
                        data will need to be deleted as soon as this time period expires.
                    </li>
                    <li>The individual withdraws their consent. This can apply to either some or all of the data, dependant on circumstances.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
