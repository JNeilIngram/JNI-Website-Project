            <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
            </h2>
            <p>As discussed above a trello board was created for this task but was more of an additional task than anything useful. A 
                simple "to do" list would have been far more effective and less time consuming for a simple solo project such as this. 
            </p>
            <p>Also as previously mentioned, the way the tuition was structured for this part of the exercise was incorrect and led to 
                inefficient time usage.
            </p>
            <p>If this had been a team project the use of the trello board (possibly with slack, but not necessarily so) would have been 
                effective in coordinating efforts and eliminating duplication of work. 
            </p>
            <p>As slack is a message board it essentially duplicates most of the functions of the trello board. It could be useful in a 
                collaborative effort where the parties to a project are not in the same location.
