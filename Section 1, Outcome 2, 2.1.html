            <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you 
                used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h2>
            <p>Initially it was about answering the core questions to be included in the website, which was done using wordpad. As the 
                course progressed and we learnt about html scripts, the bare text was put into html format with some rudimentary interpage 
                navigation.</p>
            <p>Visual Studio Code was quite user friendly in how colour coding and auto-completion assists the coder in developing code. 
                However, as I have no experience of other available editors I cannot say that this was the best or most appropriate tool for 
                the job.</p>
            <p>Subsequently we were taught how to format the look and feel of the webpage using css. </p>
            <p>Codepen was not used as it was not part of the course.</p>
            <p>A trello board was set for this project, but as stated elsewhere this was not all that useful as this was a solo and fairly 
                linear project.</p>
